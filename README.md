I am Özge Hülya Durgut. My departman is Electrical and electronics engineering.

I support design and electrical operation for our project. This is not certain now, we will support each other. I can also support a part the software. 
Our idea is Smart Parking System, the sensors will let us know if the parking space is full or empty, we will save the information about which car has come to the parking lot and how many times it has by creating database. We will give the 9th parking to the person who has parked 8 times in the parking.
